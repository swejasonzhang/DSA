# Given a string s, return the number of substrings within s that are palindromes.
# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc"
# Output: 3

# Explanation: "a", "b", "c".

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "aaa"

# Output: 6

# Explanation: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa". Note that different substrings are counted as different palindromes even if the string contents are the same.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consists of lowercase English letters.

# Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

# Output: true

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.
# You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

# Return the answer with the smaller index first.

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

# Output: [0,2]
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
# Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

# Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

# Example 1:

# Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
# Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
# Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
# - Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
# - Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

# Example 2:

# Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
# Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
# Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
# Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

# Example 3:

# Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
# Output: [true,false,true]
